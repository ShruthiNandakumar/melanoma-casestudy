## General Information
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:
Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion

## Technologies Used
pathlib
tensorflow
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy 
pandas
os
PIL
keras
layers
Sequential
glob

## Conclusions
* Using Augmentor library helped.
* Model can be improved by tuning hyperparameters
